Julia's REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop, the terminal where you type Julia commands) has special modes you can activate by pressing specific keys:

🔹 ; → Shell Mode
This lets you run Linux shell commands without leaving Julia.

Example:
julia
Copy
Edit
julia> ;  # press semicolon
shell> ls -l
This runs the ls -l command as if you were in your terminal (bash, zsh, etc.).

You can also assign output:

julia
Copy
Edit
julia> run(`ls`)  # does the same thing from normal mode
🔹 ] → Package Mode
This opens Pkg mode, where you manage Julia packages.

When you press ], the prompt changes to:

css
Copy
Edit
(@v1.10) pkg>
Now you can use commands like:

julia
Copy
Edit
(@v1.10) pkg> add Plots
(@v1.10) pkg> update
(@v1.10) pkg> status
(@v1.10) pkg> rm Plots
Exit back to Julia prompt by pressing Backspace or Ctrl+C.
