what is Pluto.jl: reactive notebook , is it better than jupyter


ChatGPT said:
Pluto.jl is a next-generation reactive notebook environment for Julia. Think of it like a smarter, more interactive version of Jupyter — but built specifically for Julia.

🧠 What is a reactive notebook?
Pluto notebooks behave like spreadsheets:

If you change one cell, all dependent cells automatically re-run.

You don’t need to manually run cells in order.

The notebook is always in a consistent state.

That’s what makes it reactive.

🔍 Pluto.jl vs Jupyter Notebook
Feature	Pluto.jl	Jupyter Notebook
Language support	Only Julia	Many (Python, R, Julia, etc.)
Reactivity	✅ Automatic re-evaluation	❌ Manual (you run cells yourself)
Built-in UI	✅ Sliders, inputs via @bind	⚠️ Requires extra packages
Live coding	✅ Feels interactive and modern	🟡 Less dynamic
Version control friendliness	✅ Code is saved as pure Julia file	❌ Saved as JSON, harder to diff
Speed	✅ Very fast for Julia code	🟡 Slower due to general-purpose backend
Installation	Only Pkg.add("Pluto") and Pluto.run()	Needs IJulia, Jupyter install etc.

✨ Example: Interactive Plot in Pluto
julia
Copy
Edit
### A Pluto.jl notebook ###
begin
	using PlutoUI, Plots
end

@bind n Slider(1:100)

plot(1:n, sqrt.(1:n))
This will display a slider, and the plot will update instantly as you move it. No "Run cell" needed.

🛠 How to use Pluto.jl
In Julia REPL:

julia
Copy
Edit
using Pkg
Pkg.add("Pluto")
Run it:

julia
Copy
Edit
using Pluto
Pluto.run()
A browser tab opens where you can create interactive .jl notebooks.

🧾 Summary
✅ Better than Jupyter for interactive, Julia-only notebooks.

❌ Not suitable if you need multi-language support (Python, R, etc.).

🎓 Ideal for learning, teaching, visualizations, and reproducible science.
