o return from shell mode to the Julia REPL mode, you simply need to press the backspace key (or delete key on some keyboards) at the beginning of the line.

Here's how it works:

You are in shell mode: You'll see a prompt like shell> or julia> followed by a semicolon ; (e.g., julia> ;ls or shell>).
Press backspace: If your cursor is right after the shell> or julia> ; prompt, just hit the backspace key.
Return to REPL: The prompt will revert to the standard Julia REPL prompt julia>.
Example:

julia> ; # Press ; to enter shell mode
shell> ls
# (output of ls command)
shell> # (Cursor is here)
# Press backspace
julia> # You are back in REPL mode
